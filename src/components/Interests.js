          Outside of programming, I like to spend my time playing music and
          teaching. As a musician, I have been fortunate enough to have
          performed in the Music in the Summer Air (MISA) Festival in Shanghai,
          London New Year's Day Parade, Bellingham Symphony Orchestra,
          Marrowstone Music Festival, and Bellevue Jazz Festival. I have also
          had the privilege to open for and perform with Grammy award-winning
          artists.

          As an educator, Daniel has worked with thousands of students from
          across the United States. He has taught with the Seattle Youth
          Symphony organization, North Sound Youth Symphony, as well as with
          Seattle Music Partners to provide free after-school music lessons to
          students in Seattleâ€™s Central District. Before moving back to Seattle,
          he had a thriving trumpet studio in Bellingham, WA where his students
          have achieved principal chairs in state level honor groups and won
          regional solo competitions.
